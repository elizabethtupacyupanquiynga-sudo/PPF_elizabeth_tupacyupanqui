## Development

When starting the dev server, use background mode:

```
astro dev --background
```

Manage the background server with `astro dev stop`, `astro dev status`, and `astro dev logs`.

# Internationalization rules
This project supports:
- Spanish: es
- English: en
Spanish is the default language.
## Rules
1. Never hardcode user-facing text inside Astro components.
2. All visible text must be stored in `src/i18n/ui.ts`.
3. Components receive the current language using the `lang` prop.
4. Use `useTranslations(lang)` to obtain translated strings.
5. Never create separate components for Spanish and English.
6. Use Astro's native i18n utilities for localized URLs.
7. All new pages must support both `/es/` and `/en/`.
8. The `<html lang>` attribute must match the active locale.
9. Navigation links must preserve the current language.
10. Any new user-facing content must be added in both languages.
